# Space Invaders
Space Invaders game using pygame.

## Description
Simple clone of a space invaders type game where the player controls a ship that can move and shoot. He has to avoid projectiles from computer controlled enemies while trying to shoot them for points.

There are two types of enemies, simple pawns and bosses. Bosses take 15 bullets to be killed as opposed to one for regular enemies. Difficulty gradually increases through increased enemy bullet speed, increased shoot rate and more enemy spawns.

The score is only updated as the last bullet of the killed enemy leaves the window, as dying from a bullet of a killed enemy is a 'trade'.
